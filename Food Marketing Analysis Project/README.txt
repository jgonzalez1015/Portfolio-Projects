Food Marketing Analysis

This project was my attempt at exploring UFood's data and making business recommendations for their marketing team. UFood is a leading food delivery app in Brazil, with customers in over a thousand cities. Their marketing team is looking for insights and recommendations in how to spend their annual budget for the next business year.

For this project, I created a Jupyter Notebook using Python. I utilized several Python libraries: Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib. 

This was my first time exploring the Seaborn package. I used it for visualizing the data, while exploring it. I was able to get a better sense of different correlations and relationships between variables in the dataset.
